  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  The Farm cliker is a simple game, which allow you to empathize with the role of farmer. <br />
  You can breed rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows and horse, but watch out for wolves and foxes.
  Buy dogs to defend against them. <br /> Dog breeding is unprofitable, so you must choose: profit or safety.
  Only skilful balancing allows you to become a super farmer! <br /><br />
  <h3>Breed</h3>
  You can buy and sell seven types of animals: rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, horse, small dog and big dog. <br />
  The price is given in brackets on the buttons. Pay attention on the capacity of your farm.
  It is given above the end of day button. <br />
  When you and and day, your animals reproduce. Rabbits starts, sheep are next and so on.
  It is important, because if you have to small farm bigger animals do not reproduce. <br /><br />
  <h3>Farm Management</h3>
  You can bay and sell seven types of farms: pen, tiny farm, small farm, big farm, small ranch,
  big ranch and huge ranch. <br /> Watch out for the huge ranch! You can not sell them,
  because is too big for everyone. You can abandon them of course, but it is not good business. <br />
  <h3>Threads</h3>
  Breeding animals and farm management is great, but you have to be careful.
  The nearby forests are full of wolves and foxes! <br />
  They are very hungry! Only one fox can eats all rabbits, even if you have thousands of them! <br />
  Foxes are too small to beat a bigger animal than a rabbit, but wolves not.
  They eat everything! Everything except the rabbit. Wolves think they are not tasty.<br />
  Once in a while some wolves and foxes attack you. Over time, there will be more and more of them. <br />
  Buy dogs to protect your farm. When wolves attack fight only big dogs. <br />
  If you have more big dogs then wolves, you win and all wolves die. Otherwise die all big dogs.
  If it is equally, you win, because you command your dogs very well! <br />
  Small dogs alive, because there are too fast for wolves. They fight with foxes on the same conditions as above. <br />
